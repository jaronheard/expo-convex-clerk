description: Provides guidance on using Clerk with Convex, ensuring correct components and hooks are used for authentication. Key principles: use Convex's <Authenticated>, <Unauthenticated>, <AuthLoading> instead of Clerk's equivalents, and use useConvexAuth() hook instead of useAuth().

When integrating Clerk with Convex for authentication, please follow these guidelines:

1.  **UI Components for Authentication State:**
    *   Instead of Clerk's `<SignedIn>`, use Convex's `<Authenticated>`.
    *   Instead of Clerk's `<SignedOut>`, use Convex's `<Unauthenticated>`.
    *   Instead of Clerk's `<ClerkLoading>`, use Convex's `<AuthLoading>`.

    These Convex components correctly manage UI rendering based on the authentication state within the Convex environment.

2.  **Authentication Hook:**
    *   It is crucial to use the `useConvexAuth()` hook from Convex instead of Clerk's `useAuth()` hook.
    *   The `useConvexAuth()` hook ensures that the browser has fetched the necessary auth token for authenticated requests to your Convex backend and that the Convex backend has validated this token. This provides a more reliable authentication status in the context of a Convex application.
