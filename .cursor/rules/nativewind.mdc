# NativeWind Usage Guidelines

- Prefer `className` with NativeWind over inline `style` declarations.
- Compose dynamic classes using the `cn` utility from `@/lib/utils`.
- Use `web:` and `native:` prefixes for platform-specific styling.
- Keep shared design tokens in `tailwind.config.js` and avoid hard-coded values.
- Avoid other styling libraries when a NativeWind solution suffices.
