# React Native Reusables

- Prefer primitives from `@rn-primitives` (e.g., `Slot`, `Avatar`, `Checkbox`) instead of reinventing common UI building blocks.
- Wrap these primitives with NativeWind classes to style them consistently.
- Use the `asChild`/slot pattern to customize underlying elements while preserving accessibility.
- Avoid duplicating functionality that already exists in the primitives library.
