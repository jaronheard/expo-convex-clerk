# Reference Code

This folder contains reference code from the original app that is being rewritten.

**Important Notes:**

- This code is for reference only and should not be imported or used directly
- The reference folder is excluded from all development tools:
  - ESLint (linting)
  - TypeScript (type checking)
  - Tailwind CSS (style scanning)
- Files in this folder will not be processed by Metro bundler
- This folder is tracked in git for team reference but ignored by all build tools

## Usage

When rewriting features, you can reference the original implementation here, but make sure to:

1. Adapt the code to the new architecture
2. Update dependencies and patterns to match the new codebase
3. Don't copy-paste directly - use as inspiration and reference only

## Structure

Place the original app's code in subdirectories here, maintaining the original structure for easy navigation.
